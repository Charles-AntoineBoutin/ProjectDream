# ProjectDream


Brief:


Our Game will take place in the mind of character of the game as he fights against shadows of himself,
to make his way to pieces of his soul. Those pieces of the characterâ€™s self will transform and develop
the character to make him less and less transparent since he will only start as a ghostly figure. 
The character will also become more colorful as he progresses through the game. 
Since the character will be in his mind (dream?) he will be jumping and floating around flying islands
symbolising his own world that is falling apart.
